# FTC_Robot_Controller

Main Language used: Java;


This code was used during the First Tech Challenge competition. 
It is the code I wrote with my team for The FTC 2016. Not all the code is mine, part of it was provided by the staff.
The purpose of this competition was to control a robot (build by ourselves) but also program it to do several tasks in an autonomus part. 
For this, we worked with various types of sensors. We evaluated the set of data received and costumized our code so that the Robot
behaved exactly how we wanted it to.
